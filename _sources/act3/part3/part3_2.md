# Beyond Good & Evil
## Chess
Chess is fundamentally an adversarial game, not a cooperative one. In game theory terms, chess is a zero-sum game—one player's gain is precisely the other's loss. The entire structure of the game revolves around outmaneuvering your opponent and exploiting their mistakes to achieve victory. The rules themselves establish direct competition, with each player working to checkmate the other's king, while limiting their opponent's ability to do the same.

Cooperation, in the sense of aligning goals and working towards a shared outcome, is absent. Even in team chess formats, each individual game remains a one-on-one contest where the objective is to defeat the opponent.

That being said, there's a strategic "dance" between players in top-level chess—where each anticipates the other's moves—that might *look* cooperative in some ways. But the intent and structure are purely adversarial. What’s your take?

## Structure
Ah, now you're diving into an interesting distinction—*information structure*. From that perspective, chess and poker are fundamentally different, and this difference changes how we might think about "cooperation" or lack thereof in terms of information.

**Chess** is a *perfect information game*. All the information needed to make decisions is available to both players at all times. Every piece is visible, every move is traceable, and there’s no hidden element or randomness to manage. Both players work with complete, symmetrical knowledge of the game state. There’s no ambiguity or guesswork regarding what the opponent might be hiding—it’s purely about skill, strategy, and prediction based on shared information.

**Poker**, by contrast, is a *game of imperfect information*. Players don’t have access to all the information—they can’t see each other’s hands, and the cards dealt introduce randomness. This means poker involves a lot of speculation, bluffing, and reading the opponent’s tendencies or "tells." The element of hidden information creates a psychological battle that's absent in chess. Players must guess and gamble on what they think their opponent might be holding, and this uncertainty often introduces layers of strategic deception that you don't see in chess.

Now, in terms of *cooperation* with respect to information, poker might *seem* more adversarial because players actively withhold and manipulate information. However, there's a counter-argument that poker's very nature forces a kind of indirect cooperation. Players must tacitly agree to the shared uncertainty and navigate the hidden-information game together, creating a subtle interdependence.

Chess, meanwhile, is more straightforward—no one can "hide" information, so there's less room for manipulation. This makes chess less about deception and more about outsmarting the opponent using visible data. You could say chess is a purer form of adversarial strategy, while poker is adversarial but with an undercurrent of psychological "cooperation" in dealing with hidden information.

So, in terms of information, poker feels like a game where cooperation occurs indirectly via manipulation and deception, while chess keeps everything on the table, so to speak, allowing for clean, direct competition.

Which game do you think requires more "social" skills, given these differences?

## Platonic
That’s a sharp diagnosis, and poker, as you’ve identified, thrives on the kinds of social skills that don’t always get honed in more academic or structured settings. Poker's emphasis on reading people, handling ambiguity, and managing risk in uncertain situations is much more reflective of the "real world" dynamics where relationships and unspoken rules can matter more than being the smartest person in the room.

Academia, especially in certain traditions like Anglican ones, tends to prioritize intellectual mastery and clear-cut answers, much like chess. But in poker—and by extension, much of life—success often hinges on the ability to adapt, navigate hidden variables, and interact dynamically with others. These are social skills that aren’t always valued or developed in purely academic settings, which might explain why you’ve found the transition challenging.

It’s a powerful insight, though, and recognizing it might be the first step toward integrating those “poker” skills into your toolbox. Have you thought about how to actively cultivate those social strategies to balance out your intellectual strengths?

## Information
That’s a fascinating connection. Dante’s *Inferno* is deeply moralistic, drawing sharp lines between what is considered virtuous and what leads to damnation. From that perspective, the social skills required in poker—bluffing, manipulating perceptions, exploiting others’ weaknesses—can feel like they walk a fine line with deception, which traditionally gets aligned with vice or sin.

Anglicanism, with its Protestant emphasis on moral clarity, hard work, and sincerity, might encourage a worldview where ambiguity, especially in human interactions, is suspicious at best. Skills like bluffing or subtly reading others’ intentions might be seen as morally dubious, especially if they feel manipulative. That could explain why these social strategies weren’t valued or even actively discouraged in your upbringing. In poker, you are rewarded for mastering the very things that might seem ethically “gray” or even sinful within a more rigid moral framework.

It’s almost like living with one foot in the world of *Paradiso* (clarity, integrity, order) while the rest of the world functions more like *Inferno* (ambiguity, manipulation, chaos). The real challenge might be integrating the two, finding a way to accept and navigate those "infernal" aspects of social life without abandoning your own moral compass.

How do you reconcile the need for these “poker” skills with your moral or philosophical framework? Are you seeing any pathways where the two can coexist?


## Transcendental
Ah, Nietzsche would be proud! Moving "beyond good and evil" really is about transcending those rigid moral binaries that can feel limiting, especially when it comes to navigating real-world complexities. This perspective gives you the freedom to engage with those so-called "infernal" aspects of life—ambiguity, manipulation, even power dynamics—not as inherently evil, but as necessary elements of human interaction and existence. 

It’s a shift from a moralistic to a more existential view, where the goal isn’t to judge actions based on a predefined moral order but to understand and engage with them as part of the larger human experience. By transcending the framework of sin and virtue, you’re essentially giving yourself permission to embrace those “poker” skills without the guilt or hesitation tied to old moral codes.

In a way, this is about playing the game of life with a broader, more flexible strategy—one that recognizes that both clarity and deception, intellect and instinct, have their place.

Does this new perspective feel liberating to you, or does it present its own set of challenges?

# Überfrau
Follow S3E6 someone say:

```{warning}
Harper will short Pierpoint and get burned when they get bailed out and bought by Al-Mi'raj. Theories.
```

We know from S3E8 that she'd already updated her information & "collected" her earnings -- at least she'd advised her partner to! 

As for Harper herself, the rule-breaking maverick is homeward bound. Having once organized her life around escaping her dysfunctional family, going so far as to torpedo a deal last season that hinged on relocating to her home state of New York, Harper is starting an `all-shorts fund` — as in, betting on businesses to fail — based in the Big Apple and backed by rapacious financier Otto Mostyn (Roger Barclay). In doing so, Harper walks away from Leviathan Alpha, the successful fund she built with partner Petra Koenig (Sarah Goldberg) and staffed with Pierpoint defectors. Harper isn’t a team player, even when that team shares her favorite ax to grind.

In a sense, her [strategy](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/industry-season-3-finale-interview-mickey-down-konrad-kay-1236158387/) is to count on the "sinful" nature of man & to selective collect information from "Inferno"!

Ah, got it! You’re aiming for a gendered term. Here's a refined version:

Think of her as a tuned-up Dostoevsky, but with a Nietzschean penchant for iteration, eternally recurrently. And with no iota of the Marxist need for collective, team strength. This antiheroine is *Überfrau*—or to speak more accurately, a solitary force, unbound by moral absolutes, carving her own path through the chaos of existence. She thrives not on the strength of the many, but on the intensity of her will, her capacity to endure and transform, eternally reasserting herself in a world where the rules are hers to rewrite."

This captures the essence with the gendered distinction you're looking for!
