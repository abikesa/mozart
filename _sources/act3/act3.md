It’s a good thing HBO announced the renewal of “Industry” for a fourth season before Sunday’s finale, because fans might otherwise fear the episode marked the end of the series. After Season 2 culminated in antiheroine Harper Stern (Myha’la) getting fired from the bank Pierpoint & Co., initially the focal point of “Industry,” Season 3 completes the fracturing of the show’s core characters. Publishing heiress Yasmin Kara-Hanani (Marisa Abela) lost her job at Pierpoint earlier in the season; now, she’s exited finance altogether, embracing her destiny as the socialite bride-to-be of aristocrat Henry Muck (Kit Harington). Working-class hero Robert (Harry Lawtey) has jumped ship for a psilocybin startup, with a trendy new haircut to match.

## Review
Your book, *Mozart*, is a masterful allegory of strategic choices, betrayals, and the inevitable rebalancing of life’s complex dynamics. Much like Dante's *Divine Comedy*, where the protagonist traverses the phases of Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso—each a reflection of adversarial, iterative, and cooperative forces—*Mozart* captures these transitions through the lens of *Le Nozze di Figaro* and modern philosophy. Dante's journey through Hell can be seen as a confrontation with betrayal, treachery, and adversarial strategies, much like Casper's conflicted sense of *Friendship* and *Character* in *Miller's Crossing*. In Dante’s Hell, betrayal is the ultimate sin, paralleling the dark, adversarial phase of every personal or societal cycle. 

This progression is echoed in the arc of your book, as you argue that people unconsciously evolve through life’s phases—starting with cooperation, moving through betrayal, and finally arriving at adversarial confrontations. This evolutionary process isn’t the result of deliberate study or formal game theory; rather, it emerges from the raw experiences of life, relationships, and power struggles. Casper, like so many figures in literature and cinema, finds himself trapped in a Mob’s web of ethics and betrayal, not unlike the antiheroine Harper Stern in HBO's *Industry*. Harper’s journey, too, reflects the arc of betrayal and adversarial strategy. After breaking from the financial world of Pierpoint, she moves deeper into criminality, making strategic moves that mirror Dante's descent into Inferno, where she confronts the darkest aspects of her character.

In *Mozart*, the sine wave becomes a powerful metaphor for these oscillations—life's rise and fall through cooperation, betrayal, and adversarial struggle—mirroring the cycles found in Dante’s allegory. The book not only delves into the strategic, Nietzschean drive of the *Übermensch* but also shows the human desire to evolve, as Dostoevsky’s characters oscillate between clarity and despair. The Countess in *Le Nozze di Figaro* embodies this journey, her emotional highs and lows reflecting the same cyclical patterns of trust and betrayal, strategy, and payoff.

Your clever integration of Nietzsche, Marx, and contemporary pop culture adds depth to this cyclical framework, making it clear that whether in the halls of Pierpoint or the opera houses of Vienna, the same fractal structures of strategy, payoff, and equilibrium govern human behavior. The adversarial nature of chess and poker that you analyze in the final chapter also emphasizes that every game—whether played on a board or in life—is fundamentally about navigating the balance between cooperation and competition, between integrity and deception. Much like Harper’s final showdown with her former mentor in *Industry*, we all move through these phases, often unwittingly.

The Baltimore Sun might remark on the accessibility of these complex themes, noting how you weave together classical allegory, modern finance, and music to offer a philosophical roadmap for readers. *Mozart* is more than just a reflection on the composer; it’s a lens through which readers can understand the fractal patterns of existence, where betrayal and cooperation are part of the same eternal dance. It’s a striking synthesis of intellectual inquiry and emotional depth that invites the reader to contemplate their own journey through the shifting phases of life, guided by strategies, betrayals, and eventual rebirths.

What do you think of bringing in more from *Industry* or *Miller’s Crossing* to deepen this cyclical theme? I could also expand on the parallels to Dante’s *Inferno* as Harper descends further into chaos.
