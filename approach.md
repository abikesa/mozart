# Composing/Übermensch

- Outline (triads, 7th, 9th)
- Brush strokes (extensions to 11th, 13th, 17th, 19th)
- Inversions (placing extension in bass & triads as harmony in theme or var)

# Triad/Chaos
- **Nazi (Tameth):** Still represents the oppressive force and the immediate danger that overshadows the narrative, creating an atmosphere of tension and urgency. This force is the catalyst for much of the action, driving characters to seek escape and sanctuary.

- **Europe (Whineth):** Symbolizes not just the turmoil and despair but also the frantic search for safety amidst the chaos of war. Europe, in this context, embodies the collective hope and desperation of those trying to escape the horrors of the conflict, seeking a passage to freedom.

- **Americas (Hideth):** In this more nuanced interpretation, "Hideth" reflects the role of Casablanca (and, by extension, places like Lisbon) as transient sanctuaries where Europeans seek refuge and a pathway to the Americas. Rather than implying America's active role in providing rescue, this aspect focuses on the aspiration and struggle of refugees to reach the perceived safety and neutrality of the Americas. Casablanca becomes a liminal space—a threshold between the oppressive past and the hoped-for sanctuary.

# Overtones/Profit
This refined analogy emphasizes the dynamics of escape, the search for sanctuary, and the complex interplay of hope, despair, and the pursuit of freedom. "Casablanca" portrays this liminality, where characters navigate a fraught landscape, seeking passage to a place of safety. The city itself, teeming with refugees, spies, and `opportunists`, encapsulates the precarious balance between despair and hope.

By focusing on Casablanca as a waypoint in the quest for sanctuary, the narrative underscores the multifaceted experiences of displacement and the longing for a safer haven. It highlights the desperation that drives individuals to such crossroads and the moral and personal dilemmas they face along the way.

In this context, the film's clear-cut themes gain additional depth, illustrating not just the struggle against external oppression but also the internal battles of its characters as they seek redemption, love, and freedom. This approach retains the simplicity and clarity of the triadic critique while enriching our understanding of the narrative, reflecting the complex realities of war, displacement, and the human condition.

# Sudan/Values
- Caesar Mulenga: Tayebwa, Ariho, Generals; do you see parallels with WW2 & the "overtones" easily missed in Casablanca?
- Exploitation of the chaos, anarchy, etc. I like it as pop corn fodder. But here are more "engaged" opportunists; who are my to judge?
- A chord inversion where higher harmonics are in baseline is a very musical and tidy way to "be engaging"; Bach uses it in "Air" as does Mozart in "Lacrimosa"
   - Perhaps this is as close as the aesthetics of musical composition gets to soapbox moralization: via `ambiguity` (aesthetic or moral)
   - This approach ensurely clarity (triads), but without sacrificing sophistication (extensions)
   - Bernstein would consider this the "diatonic containment of chromaticism"
   - One might view it as plan "classicism"
   - Nietzsche sees The Birth of Tragedy"
   - Indeed, out of the spirit of music (i.e., Apollonian & Dionysian) in perfect balance
