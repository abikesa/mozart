### Mozart's last testament
- D minor
- 12/8 (i.e., pockets of 3)
- Largetto

### Intro
- i-III#5/i-III6/i
- i/III-i/III-i6/III
- ii-ii7b5-iidim7
- V-V7#9-V7b9
- III-III/i-III/i
- iv-iv-iv
- V-i/V-i/V
- V-V7-V7

> The introduction sets the stage with its harmonic richness and tension-building progressions. Starting with the tonic minor (i) and moving through a series of modulations and chord transformations (such as III#5/i, III6/i, ii-ii7â™­5-iidim7, and V variations with augmented and diminished ninth chords), Mozart crafts an opening that is both haunting and evocative. The use of the III chord with alterations and inversions, alongside the minor iv and dominant V variations, prepares the listener for the emotional depth and complexity of the piece.

### Lacrimosa
- i-i-i La-a-a
- III-i/III-i/III A-a-cri-
- ii-ii7b5-ii7b5 Mo-o-o
- V-V7-V7 Sa - -
- i-i-i Di-i-i
- III-i/III-i/III i-i-es
- ii-ii7b5-ii7b5 i-i-i
- V-V7-V7 la - -

> **i-i-i**: The repetition of the tonic minor chord under "La-a-a" reinforces the somber mood, grounding the piece in its key center.
> **III-i/III-i/III**: The alternation between the mediant and tonic chords under "A-a-cri-" adds a hint of brightness and complexity, reflecting the sorrowful yet intricate nature of the text.
> **ii-ii7b5-ii7b5** and **V-V7-V7**: These progressions under "Mo-o-o" and "Sa - -" introduce tension and anticipation, leading the listener through the text's lamentation.
> **III-i/III-i/III** and **ii-ii7b5-ii7b5** sequences return, further emphasizing the piece's emotional and harmonic motifs.

### Arise (diatonically rising melody in parentheses)
- i (D minor) - - Qua - - (D)
- V7 - - Re - - (E)
- i - - Sur - - (F)
- VII7 - - Get - - (G)
- III - - (F major) Ex - - (A)
- II7 - - Fa - - (B)
- v - - (A minor) Vi - - (C)
- IV7 - - Lla - - (D)

> The section titled "Arise" illustrates the text "Qua resurget ex favilla" with a diatonically rising melody, moving from D to D across an octave, harmonized with chords that add depth and color to the narrative of resurrection and hope. Each chord and note choice underlines the text's evocation of rising from the ashes, showcasing Mozart's ability to marry melody with text in a way that enhances the thematic elements of renewal and divine judgment.

### Judgement (C minor: chromatically rising melody in first parentheses & a counterpoint of chromatically descending bass in adjascent parentheses)
- i - - Ju - - (bE)(C)
- Vdim7/vii - - Di - - (E)(bB)
- IV/bvii - - Can - - (F)(A)
- VI7 - - Dus - - (#F)(bA)
- i/V - - Ho - - (G)(G)
- bV7 - - Mo - - (#G)(#G)
- IV7 - - Re - - (A)(F)
- bVII - - Us - - (A)(A) ... I'd personally make this bB (though it wouldn't sound as sweet)

> The "Judgement" segment within Mozart's "Lacrimosa" displays a masterful use of chromaticism to illustrate the thematic essence of judgment. This is achieved through a chromatic ascent in the melody, paired with a carefully structured counterpoint of chromatically descending bass lines, each step laden with harmonic significance:

> **C minor (i)** for "Ju" sees the melody ascend to Eb while the bass descends to C, setting a somber foundation.
> **G# diminished seventh (Vdim7/vii)** for "Di" lifts the melody to E against a descending bass to Bb, weaving tension and anticipation.
> **F minor with a major seventh (IV/bvii)** for "Can" pushes the melody further to F, while the bass line moves to A, deepening the harmonic texture.
> **A# dominant seventh (VI7)** for "Dus" advances the melody to F#, contrasted by a bass descent to Ab, reaching a poignant emotional peak.
> **G minor (i/V)** for "Ho" balances both melody and bass on G, a momentary harmonic convergence amidst the tension.
> **G# major seventh flat five (bV7)** for "Mo" continues the ascent to G# with both melody and bass, intensifying the climax of this harmonic journey.
> **F major seventh (IV7)** for "Re" allows the melody to soar to A, while the bass counters with a drop to F, beginning the resolution process.
> **Bb major (bVII)** for "Us" aligns melody and bass on A, suggesting a tentative resolution. The personal inclination towards Bb as the concluding note, although it may impart a less conventional sweetness, introduces a fascinating layer of tension and release, potentially enriching the emotional palette with a darker, more reflective hue.

> This judicious combination of chromatic melody and bass counterpoint in the "Judgement" section underscores the profound thematic elements of judgment itself. The ascent and descent represent the soul's journey through judgment, encapsulated within the rich tapestry of harmonic progressions. This intricate musical dialogue not only showcases Mozart's compositional genius but also invites a deeper contemplation of the balance between divine judgment and mercy, captured through the nuanced interplay of melody and harmony.

### Chorus in D minor (see above)

> The chorus returns to D minor, reiterating the thematic and harmonic material introduced earlier. This consolidation ensures that the piece's overarching themes of sorrow, hope, judgment, and redemption are interwoven throughout, providing a cohesive emotional and musical journey.
