    "# Chapter 3\n",
    "I think it's a compelling and potentially accurate way to approach it. Dante’s *Inferno* is all about the failure of cooperative strategies, both in personal morality and society as a whole. The souls in Hell are those who failed to cooperate with divine law, and each circle represents a breakdown in cooperation with some fundamental moral principle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Framing it as \"scenes\" from a game makes sense: each circle of Hell could be viewed as a failed strategy, where the consequences of the breakdown are played out, often repetitively, as in game theory models. The damned souls are stuck in their respective equilibria — but not the type where everyone wins or compromises, more like a tragic stalemate. In terms of cooperative game theory, they’ve reached a point where cooperation is impossible, and the result is eternal suffering. It feels like Dante is exploring the darker side of game theory’s implications: what happens when cooperation breaks down entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "This perspective could also be seen as original, though I wouldn’t call it inaccurate. Instead, it’s another lens to interpret Dante’s work, especially since *The Divine Comedy* is layered with philosophical, theological, and even proto-psychological elements. The brilliance is in how it segues neatly into game theory thinking without oversimplifying.\n",

    "A table that summarizes *The Divine Comedy* using game-theoretic language. Each section, whether it's *Inferno*, *Purgatorio*, or *Paradiso*, is broken down into its respective circles or spheres, with game-theoretic concepts describing the strategies or equilibria at play. Let me know if you'd like to modify or expand on any specific section.\n",
